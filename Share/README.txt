Frost nova hardly ever procs and it doesn't 100% work because I'm a noob and didn't tweak it yet. I'm using the code from a github repo and that dude is a fuckin pro, but his combat profile doesn't LOCK & LOAD so I had to create this one.

This is what you type into the COmmand Promp after you launch "Vanilla Botter.exe" file:

1.) grind XYZ mage 9-14
2.) press home key to start / stop
3.) ensure loot is off to speed shit up
4.) type "help" and explore
5.) go fuck yourself


grind = tell is what to do
XYZ = CTRL + SHIFT + ESC WoW.exe Process ID (Win 7 click on Processes Tab and click View > Set Columns > PID)
mage = example combat profile
9-14 = example farming profile

I'm basically, cut / pasting profiles from the forums and just "trying them out" hoping it works. I"ve not recorded one myself but it is really easy to do so.

let's say you type that exact command in, and your hotbar is setup as directed above, you'll start running circles around the Venomweb Vale. All you have to do is press "home" key to start and stop the bot.
